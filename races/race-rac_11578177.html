          <td>Held up in rear - not clear run over 1f out - no impression (jockey was questioned regarding his riding of gelding over final 2f after reporting at scales that he had been denied a clear run in home straight; jockey was questioned specifically as to why he had appeared not to make greater effort to improve his position and obtain a run that existed between rivals for some distance approaching final furlong; in explaining his riding jockey indicated that due to his positioning down the inner at rear of field - he had made the decision from leaving back straight to ride for luck and search for inside runs rather than potentially be forced extremely wide when mounting his challenge; he continued by saying that he wanted to be certain that the run which presented itself shortly after straightening for home remained open as he was conscious that a rival in front of him had set a solid pace and was giving ground - whilst that rival was also under pressure to his outside and his rider had whip in his right-hand; for this reason he had been reluctant to fully commit gelding into a gap which in all likelihood would close; however he was nudging gelding along and keeping the revs up at same time before - as he had anticipated passing 1f marker - gelding was denied a clear run between rivals and had to check off heels; he added that there were two factors behind his thinking in not committing for what he considered to be a low percentage gap - firstly that gelding was dropping back in trip and is not known for having a turn of acceleration and secondly that he had suffered a very heavy fall on the all-weather in October 2024 and considered that by putting gelding into a narrowing gap - which it would not have the pace to necessarily quicken through before it closed - would present a heightened opportunity for him to suffer serious interference)(op 7/2 tchd 10/3 and tchd 9/2)</td>
