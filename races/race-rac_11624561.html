          <td>Dwelt start - in rear - going okay but plenty to do over 1f out - pushed along and good headway inside final furlong - never near to challenge (inquiry held into running and riding; jockey said his instructions from a tricky draw in stall 10 - were to drop in and seek to find cover somewhere around mid-division ideally before looking to mount his challenge between runners in home straight; however after mare had been slowly away he found himself towards the rear of the field and elected to fold across in behind runners and obtain the cover his trainer desired; he stated that despite being further back than intended - he was not that far off the leaders on settling and through the middle stages but unfortunately Blue Empress - which he was tracking in three wide line - was under pressure leaving back straight and thus was not providing him with a tow into the race and there had also been significant interference just in advance of him near 3f marker; as a result of this he was faced with the decision of either hooking the mare wide and making a long sustained run to improve his position - which he felt would not be viewed favourably by his trainer or take his medicine and continue riding for luck - hoping to find a passage between runners; he added that he was focussed on keeping mare balanced and going through the gears slowly before looking to pounce with a late challenge; he further added that mare had flattened out over final 110yds and she was being comfortably held by first three horses to the line; his explanation was noted)(op 6/1)</td>
