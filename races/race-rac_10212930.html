He added his instructions were to sit in mid division - creep into the race and do the best he could. He said his saddle slipped after the false start which had to be readjusted and as a result of this he jumped off much further back than planned. Jockey further added that his mount jumped poorly and he felt it may be suited by better ground in future. Trainer confirmed the instructions given and stated that he had walked the track before hand and felt the better ground was on the inside which formed part of his instructions. He added that he was disappointed that his charge was so far off the pace - but felt the saddle adjustment had contributed to this along with the testing ground conditions)(op 22/1 tchd 33/1)</td>

He said the gelding made a little noise in running - but jumped and travelled well throughout. Jockey further added that he had not ridden in a race for three years and his fitness was a problem - but accepted that he should have made more of an effort to get into contention and that he should have finished much closer. Trainer confirmed the instructions given and was happy the rider kept wide and out of trouble for much of the race. He also reported that the animal had mad a noise on pulling up. Trainer concluded by outlining the riders inexperience and fitness levels - but was also strongly of the view that it looked bad up the straight and that the rider should have finished a lot closer. Having viewed the recording of the race and considered the evidence - the Stewards noted the trainers explanation. They were - however - of the opinion that the jockey was in breach of Rule 212.A.(ii) and having considered his record - they suspended him for 10 racedays and ordered that he forfeit his riding fee. Furthermore - the Stewards suspended Duffys Hodey for a period of 42 days as a consequence of the riders actions in accordance with the provisions of Rule 212.C(d))(op 33/1 tchd 28/1)</td>
