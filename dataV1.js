Unfortunately, it was such a wet summer last year and we never got a chance. Everyone kept labelling him a soft ground horse but he's not a soft ground horse. I was delighted to see him win like that again today. I know some of the field will improve for today but Mr Fabre's horse was fit and he's no mug - he was third behind us in the French Guineas when we were runner-up. Haatem is also a serious horse. The Lockinge and the Prix d'Ispahan are the options now. We've got to get him a Group 1 and we'll do what is best for him so it's not decided yet. We'll see how the dust settles after today - Roger Teal, trainer."

We won this with Tip Two Win and he could possibly be as good. He's got a similar profile, he's got speed, he's got a turn of foot and he's got a good cruising gear. He's in the Futurity here but we'll play it by ear, we'll see how he comes out of today. If all's well and the owner is happy we might take a punt on it.

He's a speed horse, he's probably a miler that will get a mile and a quarter. He's very genuine and could go to the Breeders' Cup Mile or the Cox Plate - Aidan O'Brien, trainer."

Today he was green as well but a lot better. We think that race will leave him in a very good place. I'd imagine he'll go to Doncaster. We think he'll step up loads from today.

Ryan said he only realised he was racing with 50 or 100 yards to go. We felt we could run him anywhere, but looking at that I would probably like to give him another run before going into a big one. He was just half-speeding at home and then we come here today and he hardly took hold of the bridle. That can happen with horses first time - it happened with Paddington at Ascot last year.

He just got in a pocket and he doesn't quicken - he lengthens. The winner and the German horse just kept us in a bit longer than Richard [Kingscote] would have wanted, but I can't give any real excuses as they've obviously gone a nice fair gallop and everyone's had a chance. He's a legend of a hose for us and that's another good run. He'll definitely go back to Ascot for the Queen Anne [second last year] as that's always been the plan, but this year it's a much deeper race than last year. It's nigh on the race of the week and he'll go there sort of 20-1, but he loves the track. He could run his absolute guts out and finish fourth - Harry Eustace, trainer."

Asking him to really quicken and work around the bend into the straight probably wouldn't have been ideal, either. We'll see how he is in the morning but the plan would very much now be to run at Flemington in two weeks' time. We'll put him in the mile and the 2,000-metre [ten-furlong] races but I think we'll keep him to this distance, although I would be very happy either way. I think it was more fitness than him not staying today - Harry Eustace, trainer."

All we need to do now is make him a winner this year. Australia has always been the end of year agenda and we'll work back from that.

Today he was really calm and really good going down. We saddled him in the stables and walked him across. He'd run a very good race in the July Stakes. We'd always planned to come here and his race last time nearly put us all off but why not have a go? You couldn't fancy him really although I said to my son I thought he'd run well. I think he'll get further. Tom said he went too early today - William Haggas, trainer."

Lead Artist controlled the race, dominated it very well and has improved greatly. He didn't like the ground at Newmarket because it was too soft. Hopefully he's good enough to come back to the Celebration Mile here. He missed all of last year. His first start was in the Wood Ditton. He's a horse on the upward curve and there's plenty of racing to come. If he gets better and better he could be a lovely four-year-old too - John Gosden, joint-trainer."

I've had that much belief in him and sometimes you go home at night and think 'have I lost the plot all together?' because that's how he does things, he does it so easily and his change of gear is incredible. The race couldn't have worked out any better, fair play to the team he was in great form today. He's done nothing but improve. He's an out-and-out miler, he's all about speed.

I had to try and pick a path with him but he's genuine and easy to deal with and he's got a bright future ahead of him. Obviously at the moment it's all wet [on the grass] so this was a nice opportunity for him to have another run on this surface. He'd handle a little bit of cut in the ground but he's a very fast horse with a low action, so he would like decent ground. He's a speedy miler. It was a really good performance and he deserves to go up in grade now. I thought this was a warm race and he gave away weight to all of them, so I'm delighted - William Buick, jockey."

However, he'd always shown he was a horse on the up. We'll have to see what Sheikh Ahmed [Al Maktoum, owner] wants to do but the Diomed is probably the next step up. He's a bit immature and Epsom might be a lot, but we have to look at what the options are and he just wants bringing along in a nice manner. He is in the Queen Anne and I don't think I'd have reservations about that, because he'll come on a lot from this and it just depends on what happens in the next few weeks. This is only his third race, so he's still got his whole future ahead of him. He's a very nice horse to have in the stable. He picked up well and finished off nicely, showing a lovely turn of foot. I think today's small field with this ground was the perfect start of him - Ed Crisford, joint-trainer."

I'd never sat on him, but he's got a good pedigree and will go further - he's got a lovely relaxed character and should improve for further. The ground is on the dead side of good, it's not bad, and rode quite nice on him. The third horse gives some substance to the form and I'd say the race will work out. He's got a bit of quality - James Doyle, jockey."

It would have taken a nice one to win today as there were some proper hardened yardsticks in there, so he had to run to his rating. There's improvement to come and that was a good effort. I haven't sat on him at home this year but I really liked him when he won his last start and I thought he had plenty of potential. He picked up and quickened really well - Kieran Shoemark, jockey."

I didn't miss the break at the Curragh too bad last time, he was just a bit raw and babyish and to be honest we didn't give him a hard time of it. I followed Colin [Keane, rider of the runner-up] the whole way around today and he's a lovely relaxed horse. I would probably like to travel a bit better, I probably looked in a bit of trouble but I knew I had Colin covered and I got it done easy. He is a nice horse for down the line - Luke McAteer, jockey."

He'd done some nice work at home but he hadn't been asked to do too much, so we thought he'd run well, but we weren't expecting that at all. It looked like a good race. I've not spoken to Jamie [Spencer, jockey] or Hamad yet but it's hard not to be excited by the way he won. Without a shadow of a doubt he's one of our exciting juveniles. It's rare they go and win like that and I imagine he'd go straight to the Coventry now - Richard Brown, owners' representative."

He showed a little bit of greenness but he really quickened up the last hundred yards and galloped out all the way to the boards so he'll be getting a bit further than five furlongs, that's for sure. Why not? [when asked whether he could emulate the achievements of previous recent winners of this race]. He won by a wider margin today than Arizona Blaze, who was a Breeders' Cup placed horse and Bucanero Fuerte probably won in similar fashion. He's a nice horse and there's sure to be plenty of improvement - David Egan, jockey, speaking to Racing TV."

He was unlucky on debut at Ascot when he was drawn on the wing and got just a bit lonely - he'd have won if he was drawn a bit better. He's mentally quite immature but he knuckled down hard. He's got plenty of ability beneath the bonnet and is still very unfurnished. The stiff six at Ascot will be perfect and he's shown he can handle the big occasion. If he can take another step in the right direction, hopefully he'll run well. We rate him very highly and is one of our nicer colts. As far as the early types go, he was always high on the list - Hollie Doyle, jockey."

Then Oisin was at him from halfway. He said he's probably not a five-furlong horse, he probably wants six furlongs. He only really started to give him a feel late on, he's still quite raw. I guess we'll contemplate the National Stakes on the way to the Coventry. It's a stiffer track at Sandown, although very draw dependent again, or maybe we'll be a bit more sensible and try to send him to Ascot two from two, try to find a race he'd be odds-on again for. He's a nice horse going forward, I hope we've got nicer at home - Hugo Palmer, trainer."

He was professional. He travelled and did everything right. If he comes out of it well, we could look at maybe one of the Ascot races - Chris Armstrong, trainer's representative."

We were on a fact finding mission today to see whether he was going to train on and he was brilliant. He's only back six or eight weeks with us and you'd never think he was away at stud. He's so cool and calm, we even said to David [Egan, jockey] going out to wake him up a little bit because he's so relaxed. He finished out the race well, he galloped right to the line. He put plenty of daylight between them. There is a race in Cork in three weeks time and he'll be entered for the Nunthorpe. He's not in Ascot. We'll see after a couple of days how he comes out of the race and then make a plan from there - Adrian Murray, trainer."

I think we are close enough to warrant a kick at the July Cup, a race in which three-year-olds have done really well in the past.

I think he got a little bit frightened as a juvenile, so we've worked and worked and he had some precious turnout up until Christmas at home. The whole team has worked really hard to be sure that we've kept him right and Jim [Crowley, jockey] seemed to really strike a chord with him in the July Stakes, so I'm just pleased the whole plan has come off. I was a little worried the ground would be too easy for him, but that didn't seem to be a problem. The Commonwealth Cup is absolutely the plan, and the Sandy Lane would be nice. We're looking forward to seeing him on a better surface and Jim has given him a super confidence-building ride. Winning was a super bonus I wasn't entirely sure would happen - Clive Cox, trainer."

His homework suggested he was good enough to win on his debut, but he was a little unlucky there as he went down by a neck having jumped the road at Salisbury. He won next time out at Nottingham, again over 5f, but I thought he was crying out for an extra furlong on that occasion. He could have gone to Royal Ascot but he just wasn't ready. He progressed from his win to his third run in the July Stakes at Newmarket. I was positive about his chances there and he duly obliged, running out an impressive winner. We now have to decide which route to take. I am not one to waste my owner's money on lots of fancy entries, so you can tell how much I thought of him as I had given him an entry in the Gimcrack before he ran at Newmarket. But if he went to the Gimcrack he probably could not go for the Group 1 Prix Morny which is just over a week later, but if he goes to the Richmond at Goodwood on Thursday there would be the ideal time between races. So, at the moment I'm leaning towards Glorious Goodwood, but we will see how the horse is before finalising plans. 02-08-23"

He made the perfect start to his career last year winning both starts, over 6f at Haydock and Windsor. He has not added to those this season but only lost by a head at Lingfield and more recently a neck in the 26-runner Palace of Holyroodhouse Stakes at Royal Ascot when runner-up. Since then, he was drawn out on the wing at York and didn't fire behind Nymphadora on ground that was possibly too much on the easy side. I have a lot of confidence in him and I think when he gets more experience he could progress into a proper 5f horse. If things were to fall into place this week he could be in the Goodwood team for the King George Stakes on Friday, but not if the rain has a major say in the going. 02-08-23"

I chose the Lindum York Handicap as the starting point and he led from start to finish to beat Korker. His best runs have been when he's made the running, but he can fluff his lines at the start and you don't have time to repair the damage over 5f. He's up to a career-high mark of 105 now and ideally I'd like to go for the Achilles Stakes at Haydock, followed by the City Walls Stakes at Chester, and if all goes well have a crack at the Nunthorpe. That comes at a time when some of those stepping up in grade can run huge races. 01-06-23"

I imagine Ralph [Beckett, trainer] dropped him back to five just to sharpen him up for Ascot and that'll do him the world of good confidence-wise.

He has run loads of good races for us and probably just been a bit unlucky here and there. He had done well over the winter and we were really looking forward to this year. He was impressive when he won in Sweden last year and we were hoping he'd outrun his odds today. Tom has given him a great ride from the front and got the job done. Kevin is a fantastic trainer of fast horses and it looks like he's bought another nice one for us. He's in the Duke of York and Greenlands in Ireland and we could look at Royal Ascot further down the line. We will see what the boss says - Cosmo Charlton, racing manager for owners Hambleton Racing."

He bumped into Shaquille at the start of the year and you've seen what he's gone on to do. He's had his day in the sun today. Thankfully we had a few owners out here as well who enjoyed it. He's been at the top table in these handicaps all year, so I'm sure there's more races in him - Adam Ryan, trainer's assistant."

She didn't so we're probably a little bit disappointed but it's not as though she's run tenth. She's run well but probably not as well as her last couple. I didn't like her last 50 metres, she was there to run second or at least third and she was a little bit plain in that last little bit. Whether she's reached her peak or she's on the way down, or whether she didn't like the track, I'm not sure. We might go to Ireland for the Flying Five but if anything comes out of the run and we're not happy with her she'll be going home - Henry Dwyer, trainer."

We came over in the nice interchange period and Asfoora settled in brilliantly. The proof of that was in the pudding today. I've got to have a look at the race conditions again but we'd love to showcase her a bit. Everyone has just been so good to us over here and I'd love to send her down to Goodwood and up to York, but we'll put the horse first - Henry Dwyer, trainer."

She ran a good race at Bath behind the winner when they beat the track record and then she probably veered off the line at Newmarket last time. The older she gets the faster she's getting as she's a bull of a horse. She likes that quick ground and since we've put the visor on her she's improved. She's a quick filly and the stiff five at Ascot would be right up her street. If it was fast ground there I think she could run a massive race. She'd be the fastest I've ever had - William Knight, trainer."

She was drawn 12 and got shuffled back to halfway. She was only beaten three-quarters of a length at the line but finished sixth and didn't get her Group 3 place, which is important for a filly, so we said we'd take our chance today, especially when the rain came' - Richard Hughes, trainer."

He's a course and distance winner at Longchamp and he'd get 18lb off his elders.

He raced against Whistlejacket the whole way, but still ran a huge race and was beaten just over a length. This was the obvious race with half an eye on Goodwood and he's sharpened up. James was very happy but we'd have preferred something better to lead us into the race. James was trying to keep hold of him so he didn't land in front three furlongs out. I'm sure he'll improve again with a strong pace to aim at. My immediate thought is he'd travel well in a Molecomb - Archie Watson, trainer."

I've always thought a lot of him and I think he'll turn out to be very good at this trip, though whether he's quite tough enough at this stage we will see. He's getting weight-for-age and we've seen this race fall to three-year-olds, including my own winner Equiano. I thought he ran well when he was third over six furlongs the other day because over that trip he needs to be covered up, otherwise he does too much too soon. He ended up following horses who didn't take him far enough into the race and found himself ten lengths adrift of the winner at one stage. He picked up really well and made up a lot of ground before paying for that late on, on a day when it worked out he wasn't drawn on the right part of the track. Back at five furlongs he won't need holding on to and I could see him running very well.  11-06-25"

Ponntos got into his normal groove and was slightly away from us which maybe suited him but not us; it would have been nice to have direct aim at him. West Acre got away well and got into a nice position. He dug deep, was gritty and galloped out well after the line. I fancy he could be even better over the six furlongs of the Al Quoz Sprint - Callum Shepherd, jockey."

Colin [Keane] rode him beautifully. In truth, I was concerned he might over-race with no cover on the outside, but I told Colin if he relaxes on the way down [to the start], he should relax on the way back. When he quickened he went, and it took two or three strides and he was off. Let's hope the owners want to go to Ascot and have a look at the St James's Palace Stakes - John Gosden, joint-trainer."

Given another 25 yards the race would have been ours.    You'll probably find Field Of Gold has run a better race than he did in the trial but a trial is a trial. When this track gets fast like this it can ride slick with a crosstail wind and they can get away from you. It just got away from us, I'm afraid, as we came into the Dip from where he was clawing the ground back. I could see it was lost going into the Dip as we were just too far back and the winner got first run. We'll talk with the family about where we go next but I think you're looking at a St James's Palace Stakes after that - John Gosden, joint-trainer."

He went to his girth and had a good blow, but then he's entitled to. Field Of Gold did it in splendid style and it's nice to race on some really good ground today and he just flew off it. It would be nice to win, but it's not something you necessarily worry about - I don't think about it at all. I suppose Kingman was slightly unfortunate as he went four lengths clear and thought he'd done enough and got caught late on by a very good horse in Night Of Thunder, who has become a top stallion. It's lovely to have a horse going for the Guineas and it's great for Juddmonte, because they have both the winner of the Greenham and this, so they're double-handed if they want to. But the family will decide whether one goes there and one goes to France or what we do - John Gosden, joint-trainer."

When the pace is usually strong and even, if you have the best horse you have a chance. I'm never confident, I'm always hopeful. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but Ryan [Moore] gave him a brilliant ride. I think he could be a miler. We think he's going to be a St James's Palace horse, but the lads will decide that - Aidan O'Brien, trainer."

We will see what we have for the Phoenix Stakes and we will see if we go up to seven next time. He's a lovely horse, though, he tries very hard and he has an unbelievable pedigree. That was my fault [when asked if he was surprised Moore had chosen Tunbridge Wells]. I thought he was a bit more forward and a bit hardier. It was hard to assess Henri Matisse after the first day. He made hard work of it and I put him on the wrong one. I would say the winner is a National Stakes horse. If he was to go again before that it would be the Phoenix Stakes or the Futurity. We haven't really leaned on the colts yet. Hopefully from here on they will really start arriving - Aidan O'Brien, trainer."

It was a really good, solid run and the horse is progressing, as it's one of the toughest Prix Mornys I've seen in a number of years. I've won the race twice and this horse is better [than Bad As I Wanna Be and Arcano]. What I really want to do is take him to the Breeders' Cup.

He outstayed them, I felt. People are obviously going to ask about him being the only horse we've entered in the Derby but most importantly we're going to enjoy today and let the dust settle and try and formulate a plan as to whether we stick to that Derby route. I'd be confident that we will do, hopefully, but they're the kind of decisions that we'll make collectively. When you watched them walk round the paddock he's got the High Chaparral (damsire), he's got that sort of length to him that you can see him as a Derby horse and that's what we had our minds on during the course of the winter - Charlie Appleby, trainer."

I'm very lucky in that I can put these horses away and allow them to develop. I think he'll continue to develop and we will go back to Europe with a sharper model. I never want to get too excited in the immediate aftermath, but we anticipated him being a ten furlong horse, so whether we got to the Dante or take in the Guineas on route, we'll see - Charlie Appleby, trainer."

I passed a load of horses quite quickly and got there sooner than I expected but it's always hard to read with horses running for the first time. He's shown a good level of form at home and has brought it to the track. He's got plenty of pace so seven furlongs seems like his optimum trip for now but he should get a mile whenever he needs to - William Buick, jockey."

He was very complimentary afterwards so I think we'll look for something better now. He's in the Royal Lodge, but we'll see about that - Anna Lisa Balding, wife of trainer."

He has been jumping and won a graded race over jumps during the winter, and today he just got himself into a nice spot and I just gradually built along. I hadn't really asked him for everything and he was always finding plenty. Joseph's horses can do that - Ryan Moore, rider, speaking to ITV Racing."

              "quote": "Artistic Star is a smashing horse. He is May 27th foal and he has only just been ready for this now, he is still a horse in the making I feel. We wanted to go to Lingfield (Derby Trial) and that opportunity was taken away from us so this was a really good spot for him. Jessie Harrington had the full sister (Forbearance) and she was adamant she needed fast ground and so if we did get into our heat of summer the King Edward VII might seem like a target. I'd be a little bit concerned it is only two and a half weeks until Epsom and he might just bounce - Ralph Beckett, trainer."

He still hasn't really raced over a relentless mile and six furlongs and I think an emphasis on stamina in the St Leger is really going to take him to the next level. It will take another step up for him to be competitive, but I have enough faith in him that it's a realistic aim.  I think back to Subjectivist at the same part of his career and he went to the Leger and it was too sharp a test for him, but then he won a Group 1 in the Prix Royal Oak as a three-year-old - Charlie Johnston, trainer."

I've always hoped he would be a Group horse in time and I've not seen anything today that doesn't give me that confidence. If he went to Goodwood he'd have to come back to a mile and a half and Tony [Farmer, owner] is a big York man, so the Melrose has been on the radar for a long time - Charlie Johnston, trainer."

He is a nice horse to win under a penalty as that takes a bit of doing. He surprised us at Newbury and I didn't think he would know enough, that is why I started him over seven furlongs. He galloped right out to the line. Next year he will want all of a mile and a half. I think we will end up rolling the dice with a nice race in the spring and see how he goes - Ralph Beckett, trainer."

He handled the ground fine and he's an exciting horse. I wouldn't swap him for any other horse [in the Triumph].

He just relaxes more than Burdett Road and I think the New course will suit him better. He's run twice over hurdles now and hasn't made a mistake. We'll have one more run then go straight to the Triumph. We've got a few nice ones [juvenile hurdlers] so we should be able to have a good crack at it in March. We feel this horse is a bit more straightforward. We can ride him how we want to, we know he's going to stay and settle. He's taken to it really well but Burdett took a bit of time.

He's had a little bit of a freshen-up. He's been back working strongly and will run on Cheltenham's Trials day at the end of January. He's favourite for the Triumph and, from what we've seen, it's probably justified.

He's a lean individual who you don't want to over-work at home, so I knew he'd need his reappearance but he ran well off top weight. I've always planned to go for the Greatwood Hurdle, so that first outing should bring him on considerably. He lost his unbeaten record last season in the Fred Winter when very unlucky, as a swinging hurdle caught him three out, and he was fortunate not to injure himself. There's a lot more to come from him. 04-11-24"

We were short of options so we were forced into running him over 1m2f here and he was just caught for a bit of toe inside the last furlong.

He looked at Roscommon as if the trip was a bit short for him so we were looking forward to stepping him up and I don't think stamina will be any issue to him going forward. The form of the Roscommon race was strong and he handles soft ground well - Joseph O'Brien, trainer."

But I didn't expect any more than a nice run. We had a lot of horses in the race and they all came here with the same plan. I couldn't believe it when I saw him flying through the middle of them. You must remember that he came from the Flat, so he had race experience - that's a huge advantage. I imagine he'll go to Punchestown, and then we'll find something at Royal Ascot, perhaps. He was bought as a dual-purpose horse, and I am hoping in time he might turn into a Melbourne Cup horse - that would be the long-term plan - Willie Mullions, trainer."

I had wanted to run him at Newbury later that week as I felt the course would suit him more but I saw Sheikh Obaid had two other entries so I opted for Newmarket, although I know the Sheikh would not have minded where I ran him.

              "quote": "Going up from the seven furlongs to the mile was going to put us where we needed to be. Staying is going to be Military Order's forte. For a horse who got into a bit of a race for a moment he soon put it to bed when he hit the rising ground. I think he is still a big baby, he still hasn't got a clue to be honest. He is a typical horse that finds life very easy at home. He goes up and down the hill there and finds it very easy. I feel there is plenty more improvement to come. He has got the same profile as Adayar now as he finished fourth first time then won - Charlie Appleby, trainer."

He looks a really exciting recruit and the boss, Shaikh Nasser, gets all the credit. He lets me try and find horses wherever I can and he's so supportive and willing. He came to me in great condition and James Horton did a great job with him last year. We'll work back from Bahrain and I was thinking about the Ebor before then but the handicapper will have his say now. I'm going to have to slightly reevaluate now but he's a serious horse - George Scott, trainer."

He's only had three runs but he's sensible and relaxed and he's straightforward in his races. 08-06-22"

City Of Troy on his day is a very good horse, and so are we, but I hope there is more to come from him because he's still got a lot of maturing to do, so I'm looking forward to the rest of the season with him.

Dropping back into a Listed race today it was just nice to get his head back in front. I know the distance between them was a long way at Ascot the other day, but he was fourth in a Group One and he picked up a good bit of prize money and he had some nice horses behind him. I think a mile and a quarter is right for him. We went back for the stiff mile at Ascot as we felt on that track it was going to suit him and he got his just rewards. He can cope with those extremes out there today where a lot of other horses can't. He is in the Hong Kong Mile, but I think he deserves a nice break. There will be plenty of options for him next year. Horses like him can turn up in those Group One races that cut up a bit and pick up a bit of money. We might also look at those Group Three and Group Two races in France again next year - William Knight, trainer."

He had to go and win today to warrant a run in the Guineas and that's still on the agenda. It looked like there was a bit left there, which there needs to be to be competitive in the Guineas. There's improvement still to come from him, it wasn't all about today. The big challenge is he's got to convert his all-weather form across to turf, but there's no reason why he can't. He did a nice bit of work on the grass gallops last week which pleased us and made us feel he was definitely above average - William Knight, trainer."

His second start when bolting up in Listed company at Newcastle had plenty of people talking about him and I must be honest I thought he'd win but not in the manner he did. We decided he had to take his place in the 2,000 Guineas but he never got a chance to show his true colours. He got wiped out at the start, which caused him to lose his action, and from there on things never went right. Unfortunately he came back sore, having knocked a joint. It has been hard work getting him back but he's there now and ready to go again. I looked at Royal Ascot but he had a slightly dirty scope before and you must be 100 per cent for that meeting. He heads to Newmarket for the July meeting, where we'll aim for the Listed Sir Henry Cecil Stakes over a mile and then we'll look to the Thoroughbred Stakes at Glorious Goodwood. He'll run at Newmarket as long as they get nice ground and hopefully we can get him back to where he was before the Guineas. He'll have to carry a penalty there for his Listed win but it's a lesser race and hopefully it'll help him get his confidence back. We're all very excited about getting him out again. Further down the line we could look to step him up to 1m2f. 30-06-22"

This was a tough race, though, but we won it two years ago with a horse who went and won a Group 1. I'm not saying this fella will, but I hope he will! We'll reassess and see where they put him, but he'll probably be out of handicaps and into Group races now. There's lots of lovely races in Britain and abroad. He's exciting - Richard Hills, owners' representative."

He wouldn't want the ground heavy but would be fine on anything else and I like this race for him.   09-06-25"

Both Jamie Spencer and James Doyle both said he won't have a problem going to seven furlongs and they were right, again! He carried a 3lb penalty today, he got to the front very easy and I'm just delighted for the horse. It's a Group 3 but I think this Jersey was an awful lot more than it normally is. He has credit for a lot more than that I'm sure a Group 1 is coming very soon - Richard Hannon, trainer."

I said to Sean that I thought he'd get the trip very well and it seems to be this week that horses that race handy are winning. I don't think you can say that was an average performance. He looked pretty good there. He has done it on the racecourse and 25-1 seems to be a little bit generous for the Guineas. He and Rosallion do a lot of work together, Rosallion is a horse with an awful lot of speed whereas this horse gets a trip extremely well. Rosallion will get the mile and they both will probably run. We've made no secret about how special we think Rosallion is and this horse surprised me with the manner of his win today. It is nice to have two very good milers on our hands with two very good chances. I think one has an exceptional chance and one now has a better chance than he had before - Richard Hannon, trainer."

I was a bit disappointed first time and I wasn't surprised this time - I think the only surprising thing was the price. We won't be in a rush because he's immature physically and mentally, and he's not going to jump up a huge grade next time, but Trevor said he couldn't pull him up, which is a good sign - Roger Charlton, joint-trainer."

It's maybe on the quick side of good and he jumped well and travelled well, so I let him use himself with this being his minimum trip. I didn't know where he was fitness-wise, but he hit the line well enough and had a good blow after. I did think something could tap him for toe, so that's why I took him on early enough before I got headed. I was a bit worried I committed too soon, not knowing his fitness levels, but he got away with it today - Hollie Doyle, jockey."

Treve hasn't had a whole load of luck as a broodmare up until Doha, but it's so difficult when you have a brilliant racemare and they get so few chances to breed a really good one. We're very lucky and hopefully this is just the start. She ran with credit in the Nassau Stakes and Ralph has done a great job. We'll discuss with him and Sheikh Joaan to see if she runs again this season, and it's not impossible she'll stay in training at five as she's still improving - Rupert Pritchard Gordon, Al Shaqab's representative in France."

Doha is exceptionally well-bred and it's important that she wins her maiden and hopefully we can go on to better things. She's not short of speed. She's quite a racy filly - she likes to get on with it - so coming back to a mile, having not looked like we saw out the mile and a quarter last time, was the obvious step. She will stay further in time, but she's probably a bit quicker than we would expect her to be. It's stepping stones towards black type, if you're not winning your maidens it's hard to take that leap. She's done that impressively and Ralph will plan where she goes next - Hector Crouch, speaking to Sky Sports Racing."

He had a nice break after leaving Michael Bell's and he's been doing a lot of schooling since. We hope he's a Triumph Hurdle horse, so until he tells us otherwise we'll be aiming him that way. He's got to have that important first day of school out the way over hurdles first, so he'll be coming out in the next few weeks. He likes soft ground and we've got our eye on the Finale at Chepstow. 25-11-24"

We had a few races planned but the handicapper might take her off that. We'll have some fun with her - Ivan Furtado, trainer, speaking to Racing TV."

The horse on his outside brought him over to be as one for the last three furlongs but there was nothing to bring him along quick enough. I'm sure he'll be stepped up in class. He's been unlucky to bump into a real good horse first time out and he got mugged at Naas on his outside last time. He deserved today and is a lovely horse for the future for connections. He's got a great attitude and is a beautiful horse to deal with - Ger Flynn, representative for Jim Bolger, trainer of Arranmore"

Unfortunately, he cut himself and hit a vein, which then retracted, and we couldn't stop it bleeding. He had to go to the vet to have it sealed off and there was a tiny bit of infection, which put us back and ultimately ended his season. He's only four but is obviously very good. He's still an entire from a fabulous family, so our intention is to make him into a stallion if he's good enough. If he was to win a handicap, I might get adventurous and throw him in at the deep end but you won't see him before Christmas. 15-11-22"

He has not lived up to expectations this autumn, but we felt an operation on his breathing could help, which he has now had. He is a fine, big, strapping horse by Jet Away, and I have always thought he would be okay. He was fifth last time at Newbury in a decent novice hurdle and, having travelled well throughout, he made a bad mistake late on which scuppered hopes. He has been given a mark of 115 and I think he could be potentially very well handicapped come the spring. 11-01-23"

I have to admit I was a bit concerned about the ground, but he handled it well. He looked to be running very well the time before but I'd say I was running him on the wrong ground. He came back a bit sore, so we said we'd try him with a bit more ease. The race at Fairyhouse looked a very suitable race conditions-wise and, although he's been in a while, we'll definitely look for something else in the next few weeks. 14-11-22"

He's an old boy, he's in good form and he was unlucky to get touched off at Wolverhampton the last day. He's handled the track very well. He's well balanced and he travels, which is what you need. He was true and honest to the line and I couldn't pull him up towards the end. Jockeys dream for rides like that where you jump out, bowl along and nothing catches you. It was like a piece of work and we never saw another rival - Cieren Fallon, jockey."

First time out he ran a very good race when third to Korker in a valuable 15-runner York handicap, where he could have done even better if the pace had been faster. I was delighted with his second run when, again on the Knavesmire, he won a 21-runner 6f handicap off 77. That was a terrific effort which earned him a 5lb rise in the weights, and despite that I think he is still a well-handicapped horse. I will give him a break now and freshen him up. 22-06-22"

He was on the go early in the year, as we brought him back on the all-weather, and his latest start suggested he'd been on the go too long. He's quite a big, rangy horse for a three-year-old and we thought another winter off would do him the world of good, so he's gone on his holidays. He's A1 and we're giving him the chance to really mature and fill into his frame. We think there'll be more improvement in him as a four-year-old and he's one to look forward to next year. 26-09-24"

Unfortunately, I chose Catterick to start her off and the track didn't suit. She put that fourth place over 5f to good use, however, as she won at Carlisle next time having been stepped up to 6f. The handicapper has given her a mark after just two runs, but we can't use it until after a third run, which could change again. We have to find her somewhere with a penalty to carry next time and it's likely to be for fillies only. I like her a lot and she may run at Carlisle on Friday. She should make a lovely three-year-old. 30-08-23"

He's the only horse to beat Phil McEntee's Jacquelina on turf this year, who's now rated in the 80s and well thought of. He loves the fast ground and I hope he can continue to progress to pick up a couple more prizes in the Yorkshire area - Rebecca Menzies, trainer."

We tried to buy him as a yearling but could not afford him, but we did eventually purchase him at the Goresbridge breeze-ups. After a debut second place he returned to Chelmsford for his second run and won nicely over 5f. For his last run we went to Bath where he met an in-form horse of George Boughey's yet still ran an encouraging race (second). We will be ready to go any time now and there is a glut of races he could run in so I will speak to Tony before deciding, but I believe he can step up again as he has with each of his three starts. 06-07-23"

He's a fantastic little horse who pays his way and he's one of them who just loves life and is easy to train. For these older horses, soundness is the key. If they're sound they keep giving and they keep lasting; if they're not then they don't do that. I thought he was big enough [odds], but I thought he was that price because of his draw in stall ten. Between myself and Oisin [McSweeney, jockey], we made the plan to go down the middle of the track and he was always in control - Paul Midgley, trainer."

He's a funny little horse; when he's in form, he's in form, and when he isn't in form, he isn't. He's really easy to train and he's been great but he's frustrating at times as he does what he likes. To be fair to him, he's a fast-ground horse but he won on soft at Catterick the time before last. It was soft ground that you could go through and a few of the fancied ones didn't run because the ground changed overnight and we thought we'd got nothing to lose. We'd got an outside stall, where we could get over to the golden highway, and the worst thing we could do was get beat. After about a furlong, he was never going to get beat. We tried to do the same there last time but he just got beat by a progressive one of Bryan Smart's. He's paying his way, whiis great, and hopefully he'll continue to do so. 28-06-24"
